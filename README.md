Algorithm Challenge #46 – Print Alphabet A to Z (ASCII & Character Increment)
-
🔤 Problem Description
-
This challenge focuses on printing the English alphabet (A–Z) using two different approaches in C++:

Using ASCII codes

Using direct character incrementation
It helps reinforce loops, character manipulation, and understanding how ASCII mapping works in C++.

💡 What You’ll Learn
-
• Working with ASCII values
• Using loops effectively
• Incrementing character data types
• Clean console output formatting
• Strengthening basic logic in C++

🧩 Example Output
-
Alphabet from A to Z (Using ASCII)
65 => A
66 => B
...
90 => Z


Alphabet from A to Z (Using Character Increment)
A
B
...
Z

📂 File Information
-
• Language: C++
• File Name: alphabet_A_to_Z.cpp
• Challenge Number: #46

💬 Notes
-
This exercise is beginner-friendly yet essential for understanding how characters work internally.
It builds a strong foundation for more advanced data manipulation tasks.
